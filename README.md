Enterprise-grade OpenStack deployment using Kolla-Ansible 2024.2 (Dalmatian) with comprehensive automation, security hardening, and operational excellence.

## Architecture Overview

This deployment provides a **highly available, scalable OpenStack cloud** with:

- **3-node Controller Cluster**: HA services with ProxySQL and MariaDB Galera
- **Scalable Compute**: 10+ compute nodes with live migration support
- **Distributed Storage**: Ceph integration with multiple pools
- **Advanced Networking**: Neutron with OVS/OVN and DVR support
- **Enterprise Security**: TLS everywhere, RBAC, and compliance frameworks

### Key Features (Kolla-Ansible 2024.2)

- **Enhanced ProxySQL**: Default MySQL connection handling with 10-second failover 
- **Transient Quorum Queues**: Improved RabbitMQ resilience 
- **Modern TLS Configuration**: Mozilla "modern" security standards 
- **Container Engine Flexibility**: Docker and Podman support 
- **Multi-Architecture**: AMD64 and ARM64 support

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Rocky Linux 9, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 
- **Python Version**: 3.10 or higher 
- **Network**: Dedicated management and external network interfaces
- **Storage**: Minimum 500GB per controller, 200GB per compute node
- **RAM**: 64GB per controller, 32GB minimum per compute node
